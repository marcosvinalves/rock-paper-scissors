<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The website will consist in a rock paper scissors game, with a space theme. Built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>On this project, I'll be making a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, based on a futuristic theme. The game will run until the player or the invader(computer) makes 5 points, after this, the game stops and shows a button to reset the match.</p>
<h2>What I learned on the project:</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to use JavaScript in browser.</li>
<li>Understood what DOM and DOM Manipulation is and how to modify contents in the page.</li>
<li>A few more properties on CSS/HTML</li>
<li>How to Debug Javascript on Developer Tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I had difficulty on the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the beggining I had trouble handling with querySelector.</li>
<li>Make the game stop running when the score of any both players reaches 5. To deal with it I disabled the button.</li>
<li>I also had trouble trying to figure out how to colect the choice from the player. But at the end, it worked well.</li>
</ul>
